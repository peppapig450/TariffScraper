# TariffScraper

This project scrapes government websites to collect and display retaliatory tariffs imposed on the United States.  The goal is to provide a user-friendly way to understand which goods are affected by these tariffs.

## Current Coverage

Currently, this scraper targets Canadian tariffs.  Support for Mexican tariffs will be added as announcements are made and data becomes available.  Future expansion to other countries' tariff lists is planned.
